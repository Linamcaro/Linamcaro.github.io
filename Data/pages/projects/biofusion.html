        Biofusion is a 3D co-op game my team and I designed and developed using Unity and C# during a 1 week sprint, to demonstrate what we have learned after 2 weeks of learning about game development in unity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The game forces players to work as a team while demonstrating good comunication skills, where one player will have to describe each part of the given body to their partner , and their partner must correlate this description with a short text that hints at the essence of the monster.
